# Lokuma — Design Intelligence Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Use Lokuma whenever the task affects how something **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**.

### Must use for
- New pages or screens
- New components (cards, forms, modals, nav, hero sections, charts)
- Choosing visual style, colors, typography, spacing, or layout direction
- UX reviews, accessibility reviews, dark mode, responsive behavior
- Converting vague product ideas into a coherent design direction

### Skip for
- Pure backend logic
- Database / API design
- Infra / DevOps work
- Non-UI scripting

## How to Use Lokuma

**Do not decide between design-system, domain search, or routing yourself.**

If the task is about UI, design, layout, colors, typography, UX, landing pages, charts, or visual direction:

1. Keep the user's request in natural language
2. Pass it directly to Lokuma
3. Lokuma will decide the best route in the cloud automatically

### Preferred command

```bash
python3 C:\Users\SMILE\.claude\skills\lokuma\scripts\design.py "<natural language design request>"
```

Optional:

```bash
python3 C:\Users\SMILE\.claude\skills\lokuma\scripts\design.py "<natural language design request>" -p "Project Name"
python3 C:\Users\SMILE\.claude\skills\lokuma\scripts\design.py "<natural language design request>" -f json
python3 C:\Users\SMILE\.claude\skills\lokuma\scripts\design.py "<natural language design request>" -f markdown
```

## Good Input Examples

- "A meditation and sleep mobile app for young professionals. Calm, premium, organic, not too clinical."
- "A landing page for an AI note-taking SaaS. Clean, modern, trustworthy, conversion-focused."
- "A fintech dashboard for small businesses. Professional, data-dense, readable, high trust."
- "An e-commerce brand for handmade skincare. Warm, soft, elegant, natural, slightly editorial."
- "What color palette fits a luxury skincare brand?"
- "Best font pairing for a modern fintech dashboard"
- "How should I structure a landing page for an AI sales tool?"

## Practical Advice for AI Coding Assistants

### Prefer the user's original language
If the user already described what they want clearly, pass that directly into Lokuma. Do **not** aggressively compress it into keywords.

### One entry point
Do not manually choose between domain search and design-system generation.
Lokuma handles that automatically in the cloud.

### Use Lokuma early
If the user is still fuzzy about style, tone, layout, color, hierarchy, brand feel, or UX direction, use Lokuma before generating code.

## Examples

```bash
# Full product direction
python3 C:\Users\SMILE\.claude\skills\lokuma\scripts\design.py "A wellness subscription app for burnout recovery. Soft, warm, calming, organic, habit-forming." -p "Exhale"

# Landing page / conversion direction
python3 C:\Users\SMILE\.claude\skills\lokuma\scripts\design.py "A homepage for an AI coding assistant targeting startups. High trust, fast clarity, strong CTA."

# Visual design question
python3 C:\Users\SMILE\.claude\skills\lokuma\scripts\design.py "A creative portfolio site for a motion designer. Bold, editorial, experimental, but still readable."

# Color question
python3 C:\Users\SMILE\.claude\skills\lokuma\scripts\design.py "A secure but friendly fintech app for freelancers"

# UX question
python3 C:\Users\SMILE\.claude\skills\lokuma\scripts\design.py "A mobile onboarding flow with permissions, account creation, and trust concerns"
```
